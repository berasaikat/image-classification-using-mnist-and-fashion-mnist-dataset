# Image Classification using MNIST and Fashion MNIST Data Set

### Description

[The MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a first test for new classification algorithms. 
We follow this tradition to investigate the performance of _Artificial Neural Networks_ of different complexity on MNIST. However, since MNIST is too easy for accessing the full power of modern machine learning algorithms (_Convolutional Neural Network_) we will extend our analysis to the recently introduced, harder [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
